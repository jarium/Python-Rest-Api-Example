# Python-Rest-Api-Example
Python rest api example, with flask and flask sqlalchemy, using sqlite database.
For datas, i used drinks as an example. The database contains 30 elements, some of them are actually drinks and some of them are just random letters. Each element has a name and description.
For deleting, i used the soft delete method which makes you be able to delete the data and keep the data at the database
The project contains pagination. Currently set to 5 json element per page
